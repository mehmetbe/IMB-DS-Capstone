# IMB-DS-Capstone
IBM Data Science Capstone Project: In this project, SPACE X Falcon 9 rocket launch outcome was predicted using machine learning algorithms. 
Space X rocket launch data was scraped from Space X REST API using a GET request as a JSON file. Raw data was wrangled using SQL queries, Pandas, and NumPy. Exploratory data analysis was performed in Seaborn & Matplotlib.pyplot, and a dashboard was created in Dash. The geographical locations of the launch sites and their distances to nearby cities were plotted on a map using Folium. Finally, machine learning models were developed that predict the outcome (success/failure) of the rocket launch process in Scikit-Learn. Four different models were developed: logistic regression, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and decision trees. Models were compared based on prediction accuracy.
